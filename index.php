                    <p>Kerri Clarkson enjoys painting and drawing with watercolors, acrylics, oils, pencils, and pen &amp; ink. Kerri has taught art in Idaho, Kansas, and Texas and now teaches reading and math intervention in Nampa, Idaho.</p>
                    <p>Kerri painted this work as a study mixing opaque and non-opaque watercolors. Opaque watercolors form the base work while non-opaque watercolors allow the opaque colors to show through an overlaying shadow </p>
