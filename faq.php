                                How long does it usually take to receive my custom portrait once the order is made?
                                <ul><li>
                                        Watercolor paintings and drawings take 2 â€“ 4 weeks to complete. Oil paintings take 4 -6 weeks to complete.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li class="summary">What kind of photo is best to use for a portrait?
                                <ul><li>You will need to attach a clear, good quality photo of the subject matter for each painting.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li class="summary">What if I don't like the background in the photo I want used for my portrait?
                                <ul><li>You may order a background that uses a single color, a color blend, natural textures, or ask for my interpretation of the background elements to help create a unified composition of the overall portrait.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li class="summary">What if I want part of the photo to be cropped out of my custom portrait?
                                <ul><li>You should crop your photos before you send them to me, or send a photo copy with the crop marks indicated. Otherwise I will do my best to crop the photo to a good design composition according to the description that you indicate.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li class="summary">What if I have several photos to work from?
                                <ul><li>Sometimes you may have a hard time deciding which photo works best for a portrait and may want to send multiple photos. I will choose the photo that will make the best portrait composition. If you want me to use two photos to create a composition, the photos used must have the same kind of light source and I will merge the photos before beginning the portrait. There is an addition fee of $50 for any photo merging I must do to create the composition.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li class="summary">What if I want a certain color scheme or artistic style ?
                                <ul><li>I will use the dominant color scheme that you indicate. The art style will be photo realism unless you specify a style such as impressionism.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li class="summary">What if I want a special subject matter such as a landscape or a different medium such as pastel, or pen and ink that is not listed on the price page?
                                <ul><li>You may want a special commissioned work of art that captures a cherished childhood home or other special place. Landscapes are available upon special request. Also art work in other mediums such as colored pencil, pastel, pen and ink, or scratch board are available upon request. A prices quote will be given upon request.</li></ul>

                            <li class="summary">How much will I need to pay for a deposit?

                            </li>
                            <li class="summary">How will I know If I like the portrait before I buy it?
                                <ul><li>I will e-mail to you a photo of the final portrait for your approval. I will also send the bill for the completed work, including the shipping cost.
