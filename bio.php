                    <p>Kerri Calder Clarkson has been drawing and painting ever since her second grade teacher in Winnemucca, NV realized that Kerri loved drawing more than reading and writing. Eventually her reading and writing skills caught up with her passion for art. Kerri went on to major in Art Education at Northwest Nazarene College in Nampa, Idaho. </p>
                    <p>Kerri enjoys sharing her love for art. She has taught art in preschools, middle schools, and high schools as well as teaching private lessons for young aspiring artist. Kerri's most enjoyable teaching assignment was in Spearville, Kansas were she taught art and yearbook for five years. </p>
                    <p>Life for Kerri has been an adventure. With her husband Jerry, Kerri has lived in Idaho, Oregon, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Kansas and Texas. While enjoying the richness of each of these places Kerri has tried to capture their beauty. While living in La Paz, Bolivia, South America Kerri started doing portrait paintings for family and friends. Although Kerri can draw and paint just about any subject in any art style (skills picked up from teaching art students for many years) she best enjoys painting interesting people.</p>
                    <p>Many of Kerri's personal paintings are memory paintings that capture a special place or events. Some pieces are meditation pieces that show some aspect of her Christian faith. She has done several commissions for others that include: portraits of children, portraits of beloved pets, illustrations for children's education books, business brochures, catalogs, mural projects, and school projects that are too many to name. </p>
                    <p>Besides making art Kerri also bakes the best chocolate chip cookies, breads and pies whenever the weather is cool. She spends some time each day outside enjoying the beauty of God's creation. She also keeps in touch with her college bound daughters on Facebook and spends time each day with her devoted husband , Jerry and their scruffy dog, Ivan. </p>
